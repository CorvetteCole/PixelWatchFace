I LOVE contributions from the community. Your time means a lot to me and it is much appreciated. If you would like to contribute to this project, I try to maintain a few issues that are fairly self-contained and easy to implement under the "good first issue" label. Check out the issues tab to see these and others. If you'd like to do more major things, feel free to look around, fork this project etc. I am happy to discuss how to fit your ideas in to the main project here :)
