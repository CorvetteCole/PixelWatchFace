# Contributing
I LOVE contributions from the community. Your time means a lot to me and it is much appreciated. If you would like to contribute to this project, I try to maintain a few issues that are fairly self-contained and easy to implement under the "good first issue" label. Check out the issues tab to see these and others. If you'd like to do more major things, feel free to look around, fork this project etc. I am happy to discuss how to fit your ideas in to the main project here :)


  

## Misc (can ignore)
- Add subtle explanations that explain what extra features using the Dark Sky API gives you
- Add yearly subscription that covers the cost of Dark Sky API calls for a year 
If the watch checked the Dark Sky weather API every 30 minutes for 365 days it would cost $1.752 USD. Google takes a 30% cut so 1.752 = x - .3x.  x = $2.503 USD as the minimum yearly subscription cost. If I make that a simple $3/year Google would take $0.9 leaving $2.1 left over. The API costs would take $1.752 from that meaning I would make $0.348 per year per person. That is alright I guess.
- Add donation options for supporting me and my projects
- Add crowdin localization to the phone app, play store listing, and watch app where possible
- Add weather.gov as a source for US users (https://api.weather.gov/points/38.0301,-84.4988/forecast for example)
