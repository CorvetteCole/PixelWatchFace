  <string name="purchase_prompt">After the free weather APIs I used hit their limit, I spent several months writing my own weather service so that I could keep this app subscription free.
    Weather can now be activated with a small one-time purchase below. This money will support current and future development of the app, with many exciting updates planned.
    If you cannot afford to support development or don\'t want to, you can request an unlock code for free. Thanks for using my app :)</string>
